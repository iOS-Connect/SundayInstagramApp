# Instagram App Project Plan #

It would be really great to get out project group working through a multi-week project.

## High Level Plan ##
Take a few weeks to build an instagram style app using a custom backend, (probably firebase). The rest of the features are TBD, at this point.

# Week 1 #

Have 10 photos and some associated metadata (poster's name, caption) uploaded to firebase before hand to use as a base for a simple scrolling collection view
(I can do the above preparation or we can do it together before week 1 coding jam)
 
 - Invite members to the firebase project so we can all share the same database/storage
 - UICollectionView
 - Custom Cell
 - Cell Re-use
 - Storyboards and autolayout (for new members)
 - Auto resizing cell
 - JSON Parsing

(We pretty much did most of them during Sunday meetup today :) )

# Week 2 #

 - Implement camera/video recorder (maybe work on a customized camera if time permits?)
 - Add image/video caption using static table view controller
 - Upload data to firebase

No friending, liking, commenting yet just photos in a timeline. (need to keep it simple and do-able)

# Week 3 #
 - Double tap to like with heart animation
 - Commenting
 - Follow button (friending)
 - Personal profile/setting using static table view controller

# Week 4 #

Animations, custom transitions, photo filters, debugging
