Hello Hands-On iOS Project Group! 
Want to build your own Instagram app? Look no further!
For this following Sunday, we are planning to implement an UICollectionView based iOS app. 
We will integrate the project with Walmart API, which enables the app to get a list of images and texts through network calls. 
Hope see you all this Sunday!
